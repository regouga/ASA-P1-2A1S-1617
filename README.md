1st project of my Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms course. <br><br>
Problem: Mr. John decided to make a photo album. When opening a drawer in a furniture of the collection
Mr. Joao found a large amount of photographs that he had accumulated along
years. The photographs were not digital, they had been obtained from photographic roll. Mr.
John thought it would be a good opportunity to organize a family album that could
share with the children and grandchildren.
The goal would be to arrange the photos by date, however he no longer remembers the dates
of all the photographs and the machine he had used also did not save dates. As the
photographs are not digital, it is also not possible to sort by file date, or by metadata.
All that Mr. John can do is compare two photos, in some cases he thinks that
you know which one came first.
The objective of this project is to develop a system that will help Mr. John with his task.
He will begin by numbering the photographs and for some pairs indicate which of the two photographs
thinks it happened first. The purpose of the software is to indicate the temporal order of the photographs.
However, some problems may arise. It may happen that the information provided
Mr. João is insufficient and there is more than one possible organization. The software must
indicate this problem. It may also happen that Mr. John was mistaken in some
of the relations it has indicated and that it is therefore not possible to indicate a coherent order. The software
should also indicate this problem.
